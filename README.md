# QUICK USAGE
 * ROMs can be z64 (big-endian) or v64 (little endian), or .n64, of any size
 * To install: Extract the contents of wii64-beta1.1.zip to the root of your SD card
 * For SD/USB: Put ROMs in the directory named /wii64/roms,
    All save types will automatically be placed in /wii64/saves
 * For DVD: ROMs may be anywhere on the disc (requires DVDxV2 on Wii)
 * Load the executable from the HBC or in the loader of your choice
    Once loaded, select 'Load ROM' and choose the source and select the ROM to load
      (Note: to go up a directory select '..', B will exit the file browser)
 * Select 'Play Game' to play
   The game can be exited any time by pressing X and Y together on a GC pad or Classic Controller,
   1 and 2 together on a Wiimote (only with Nunchuck attached), or the reset button
     (Note: this must be done to save your game; it will not be done automatically)

# Controls
 * Controls are now fully configurable so any button on your controller can be mapped
 * The controller configuration screen presents each N64 button and allows you to toggle through sources
 * There are 4 configuration slots for each type of controller
   * To load a different, previously saved configuration, select the slot, and click 'Load'
   * After configuring the controls as desired, select the slot, and click 'Save'
   * After saving different configurations to the slots, be sure to save your configs in the input tab of the settings frame
 * Clicking 'Next Pad' will cycle through the N64 controllers assigned
 * There is an option to invert the Y axis of the N64's analog stick; by default this is 'Normal Y'
 * The 'Menu Combo' configuration allows you to select a button combination to return to the menu

# Settings
 - General
   * Native Saves Device: Choose where to load and save native game saves
   * Save States Device: Choose where to load and save save states
   * Select CPU Core: Choose whether to play games with pure interpreter
     (better compatibility) or dynarec (better speed)
   * Save settings.cfg: Save all of these settings either SD or USB (to be loaded automatically next time)
 - Video
   * Show FPS: Display the framerate in the top-left corner of the screen
   * Screen Mode: Select the aspect ratio of the display; 'Force 16:9' will pillar-box the in-game display
   * CPU Framebuffer: Enable for games which only draw directly to the
     framebuffer (this will only need to be set for some homebrew demos)
   * 2xSaI Tex: Scale and Interpolate in-game textures (unstable on GC)
   * FB Textures: Enable framebuffer textures (necessary for some games to
     render everything correctly (e.g. Zelda Subscreen), but can impact performance; unstable on GC)

   * Configure Input: Select controllers to use in game
   * Configure Paks: Select which controller paks to use in which controllers
   * Configure Buttons: Enter the controller configuration screen described above

   * Auto Save Native Saves: When enabled, the emulator will automatically load
     saves from the selected device on ROM load and save when returning to the menu or
     turning off the console
   * Copy Saves: Not yet implemented
   * Delete Saves: Not yet implemented
